# MODX Evolution

**What is MODX**

MODX is an open source Content Management System and Application Framework. Initially inspired by Etomite 0.6, MODX is an ongoing project written by Raymond Irving and a core team of contributors at the MODX Project. MODX is distributed under the GPL license and is now run by a professional team of developers from all over the world. Visit the Forums for more information.

MODX provides a fast, lightweight and powerful framework on which to deploy and secure your website and web applications. For example, it gives you a true system for registered web users and groups that is separate from administration users. You can grant some web users access to one page and others access to another page. For content management, you can easily duplicate documents, folders (and all their children!), chunks and snippets. Most significant, though, is MODX's ability to empower you to quickly and easily create and maintain a rich and dynamic website like never before.

MODX Evolution requires **PHP version 5.3 and higher**.
